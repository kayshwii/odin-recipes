    <h2>How to make CRISPY chicken parmesan</h2>
    <p>I hate all of these recipe websites that are walls of text containing some life story that has nothing to do with the food.</p>
    <p>You came here for a chicken parm recipe.</p>
    <p>Here you go.</p>
    <ul>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <li>4 chicken breast halves</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup bread crumbs (seasoned panko if you're fancy)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup grated parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mozzerella</li>
        <li>salt, pepper, italian seasoning to taste</li>

        <li>Season chicken with salt and pepper. Coat both sides with flour.</li>
        <li>Dip a coated chicken breast into beaten eggs. Transfer the breast to the bread crumb mixture, pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Set aside and let the chicken rest for 10 minutes.</li>

        <li>Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes, until the chicken is 165 degrees.</li>
